What to test:

1. Test SHA512 conversion
2. Test output to base64
3. Test with openssl
    1. Encode
        1. echo -n "angrymonkey" | openssl dgst -sha512 -binary | openssl base64
    2. Decode
        1. openssl base64 -d -base64 -A -in AngryMonkey.txt | xxd -p
        2. echo -n NN0PAKtieayiTY8/Qd53AeMzHkbvZDdwYYiDnwtDdv/FIWvcy1sKCb7qi7Nu8Q8Cd/MqjQeyCI0pWKDGp74A1g== | openssl base64 -d -base64 -A | xxd -p

Passed tests:

1. string length of SHA512 hash should be 128
2. string length of base64 encoding is 88

Tests that didn’t pass:

bug #1 XPOST doesn’t return the identifier immediately (automated)

bug #2 XPOST you can use blank password. Shouldn’t be allowed although SHA512 (automated)

bug #3 XPOST I can use ‘{“blah”:””}’ - Needs to be format of password (automated)

bug#4 XPOST doesn’t gracefully shutdown and serve the request. Need to revisit since I tried this with kill -2

bug#5 XPOST no maintaining of current keys. shutdown removes all stored entries (not automated)

bug#6 XPOST/GET No salt used for sha512 base64 encoded (SHA512 + base64 encoding)

	could be cracked with dictionary call possibly (should preface pword with a string)

	(not automated)

bug#7 No authentication/authorization step when calling the REST endpoints (totally open)

    (not automated)

bug#8 JSON response not returned from GET request, just a number (automated, but I allow for non JSON now)

bug#9 What’s the point of shutdown endpoint when nothing is saved? (not automated. dupe from above)

bug#10 2018/04/25 00:05:58 Shutdown signal recieved (misspelling, gave this allowance)
2018/04/25 00:05:58 Shutting down

bug#11 AverageTime seems off based off my elapsed time tests (nothing in spec that I could see)

bug#12 shutdown request doesn't return message in JSON format. only app records message to STDOUT (not in spec)

    (not automated but check is easily added)

bug#13 curl -v -H "application/json" http://localhost:8088/hash/!@#$%
-bash: !@#$%: event not found

    With ascii > invalid syntax

    With non-existent number: Hash not found

    Not in spec so not sure why there would be three different error messages. Should be consistent?
